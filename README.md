# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a machine learning project to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their medical data. It uses a logistic regression model trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The goal is to provide an early, interpretable, and lightweight prediction mechanism.

## 🎯 Objective

- Use supervised machine learning to classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.
- Achieve decent accuracy using Logistic Regression on tabular medical data.
- Build a simple and interpretable ML baseline model for binary classification.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Reads a CSV dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Exploration & Cleaning**: Checks for nulls, datatype issues, and dataset statistics.
3. **Splitting**: Features (`X`) and target (`Y`) are split, then divided into training/testing sets.
4. **Model Training**: A Logistic Regression model is trained using scikit-learn.
5. **Evaluation**: Accuracy is computed on both training and testing datasets.
6. **Prediction**: A simple input tuple can be used to predict if the person is healthy or at risk.

## 🧪 Sample Prediction

```python
input_data = (58, 0, 2, 120, 340, 0, 1, 172, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2)
```

- `0` → Healthy  
- `1` → Heart Disease
